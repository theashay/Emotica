                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Emotica ("we", "us", "our", or the "App") collects, uses, and
                        protects information when you use our mobile application. By downloading, installing, or using
                        Emotica, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Emotica is designed around a <strong>"Local-First"
                            architecture</strong>, meaning your personal data never leaves your device. We do not
                        operate servers that receive, store, or process your personal information.</p>

                    <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
                    <p>Unlike most applications, Emotica is specifically engineered to avoid collecting personal data.
                        We want to be transparent about what we do <strong>not</strong> do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personally
                            identifiable information (PII).</li>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> create user accounts or require registration of any kind.</li>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit your mood entries, journal notes, tags,
                            activity logs, or emotional data to any server.</li>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics SDKs such as Google Analytics, Firebase
                            Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, or similar services.</li>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use advertising SDKs. There are no ads in Emotica.</li>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use any third-party tracking pixels, cookies, or fingerprinting
                            techniques.</li>
                        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, lease, or trade your personal data to any third
                            party, because we do not have access to it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
                    <p>All data you enter into Emotica is stored <strong>exclusively</strong> in a local SQLite database
                        on your physical device. This data never leaves your phone. The locally stored information
                        includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mood Entries:</strong> Your selected mood level, emoji, associated tags, and the
                            date and time of each entry.</li>
                        <li><strong>Journal Notes:</strong> Any free-text notes or reflections you write alongside a
                            mood entry.</li>
                        <li><strong>Custom Tags:</strong> Tags you create or select to describe your activities,
                            context, or feelings.</li>
                        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your chosen settings, such as notification schedules,
                            theme preferences, and sound preferences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notification Configuration:</strong> The time and frequency you configure for mood
                            check-in reminders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This data is used solely to power the app's features on your device, including mood charts, trend
                        analysis, journal history, and data exports.</p>

                    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
                    <p>Emotica may request the following device permissions. These permissions are used locally and do
                        not involve any data transmission to external servers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong> Used to send you local mood check-in
                            reminders at times you choose. Notification content is generated locally and is not sent to
                            any server.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exact Alarms (SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM):</strong> Used on Android to ensure your mood
                            check-in reminders fire at the exact time you schedule them, even when the app is closed.
                            This permission is required by Android 12+ for precise scheduling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vibration (VIBRATE):</strong> Used for haptic feedback in interactive sensory
                            de-stress games within the app. No data is transmitted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You may revoke any of these permissions at any time through your device's system settings.
                        Revoking permissions may limit certain app features but will not affect your stored mood data.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>Emotica does <strong>not</strong> integrate any third-party services that collect or process your
                        personal data. Specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We do not use Firebase, Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, or any advertising or attribution
                            network.</li>
                        <li>We do not use crash reporting services that collect device identifiers or usage data.</li>
                        <li>The app does not make HTTP/HTTPS network requests to any servers during normal usage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The only external network activity that may occur is related to the Google Play Store itself
                        (e.g., app updates), which is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's own Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                    <h2>5. Data Export and Portability</h2>
                    <p>You have full control over your data at all times. Emotica provides built-in tools that allow you
                        to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Export to PDF:</strong> Generate a formatted, printable report of your mood history
                            for personal review or to share with a healthcare professional.</li>
                        <li><strong>Export to Excel (CSV):</strong> Download your raw mood data as a spreadsheet file
                            for use in external applications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When you export data, the resulting file is saved to your device's local storage. We do not
                        receive, intercept, or have access to these files at any point.</p>

                    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
                    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have sovereign control to delete it at any
                        time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Individual Entries:</strong> You can delete individual mood entries from within the
                            app.</li>
                        <li><strong>All Data:</strong> You can clear all application data through the app's Settings
                            menu or through your device's system settings (Apps → Emotica → Clear Data / Uninstall).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Because we do not store any data on servers, once data is deleted
                        from your device, it is permanently unrecoverable. We cannot restore deleted data under any
                        circumstances.</p>

                    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Emotica is a general audience application designed for users aged 13 and older. We do not
                        knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. To maintain
                        compliance with our safety standards, Emotica includes an in-app check during the initial setup
                        to ensure users meet this age requirement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Safety by Design:</strong> Since Emotica does not collect any personal data from
                        <em>any</em> user — and operates entirely offline — there is no mechanism through which
                        children's data could be gathered, leaked, or processed by us or any third party. This makes
                        Emotica inherently safe for all users, regardless of age.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has been adversely affected by using
                        this application, please contact us at the email address listed below.</p>

                    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>Because Emotica operates entirely offline, your data is inherently protected from network-based
                        threats such as data breaches, server hacks, or man-in-the-middle attacks. The security of your
                        data on your device is governed by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your device's operating system security features (e.g., encryption, lock screen).</li>
                        <li>Android application sandboxing, which prevents other apps from accessing Emotica's local
                            database.</li>
                        <li>Physical security of your mobile device.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We recommend that you protect your device with a screen lock (PIN, password, fingerprint, or face
                        unlock) to prevent unauthorized access to your mood data.</p>

                    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
                    <p>Emotica is available for download worldwide. Since no data is transmitted to or from any server,
                        no cross-border data transfer occurs. Your data remains on your device regardless of your
                        geographical location. This policy complies with applicable data protection regulations,
                        including the concepts outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
                        California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

                    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app's functionality
                        or applicable legal requirements. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date
                        at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
                    <p>For significant changes that affect how data is handled, we will provide prominent notice through
                        the app or on this page.</p>

                    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or Emotica's data
