                <h2>1. Scope of Service</h2>
                <p>Emotica is a wellness application designed for personal mood tracking and self-reflection. By using
                    Emotica, you agree to these terms. Emotica is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind.</p>

                <h2>2. Not Medical Advice</h2>
                <p>Emotica provides self-help tools and is <strong>not</strong> a medical device. The content and
                    utilities
                    provided by Emotica are for informational and reflection purposes only and do not constitute
                    professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or
                    other
                    qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.</p>

                <h2>3. User Data and Security</h2>
                <p>As Emotica is a local-first application, the security of your data depends heavily on the physical
                    security of your mobile device. We are not responsible for data loss arising from device theft,
                    hardware
                    failure, or unauthorized access to your unlocked phone.</p>

                <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>The code, design, icons, and audio soundscapes within Emotica are the exclusive property of Emotica
                    Wellness. You may not reproduce, redistribute, or reverse-engineer any portion of the app without
                    explicit written consent.</p>

                <h2>5. Usage Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree to use Emotica only for its intended personal wellness purposes. Any attempt to disrupt the
                    app's functionality or exploit its features is strictly prohibited.</p>

                <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>In no event shall Emotica or its developers be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or
                    consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the service.</p>

                <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in your
                    jurisdiction.</p>
