                    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Emotica mobile
                        application ("App", "Service") developed and maintained by Emotica ("we", "us", "our"). By
                        downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read,
                        understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these
                        Terms, you must not use the App.</p>

                    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
                    <p>Emotica is a personal wellness application designed to help users track their mood, maintain an
                        emotional journal, listen to ambient soundscapes, and interact with sensory de-stress
                        activities. The App operates entirely offline and stores all data locally on the user's device.
                        Emotica does not require an account, subscription, or internet connection for its core
                        functionality.</p>

                    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                    <p>By using Emotica, you represent and warrant that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are at least 13 years of age. Emotica is designed specifically for users aged 13 and
                            older.</li>
                        <li>You have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement.</li>
                        <li>Your use of the App will comply with all applicable local, state, national, and
                            international laws and regulations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p><strong>Emotica is NOT a medical device.</strong> The App provides self-help and self-reflection
                        tools only. The information, features, and utilities provided by Emotica — including mood
                        tracking, trend charts, journal entries, soundscapes, and sensory games — are intended solely
                        for informational and personal wellness purposes. They do <strong>not</strong> constitute:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</li>
                        <li>A substitute for consultation with a qualified healthcare provider.</li>
                        <li>Clinical psychological or psychiatric evaluation or intervention.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or have concerns about your emotional well-being,
                        please contact a licensed mental health professional, call your local emergency number, or reach
                        out to a crisis helpline immediately. <strong>Never disregard professional medical advice or
                            delay seeking treatment because of something you have observed in Emotica.</strong></p>

                    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>As a user of Emotica, you agree to:</p>

                            written consent from us.</li>
                        <li>Take reasonable measures to protect the physical security of your device, as all data is
                            stored locally.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Privacy and Data Handling</h2>

                    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice, for conduct
                        that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties, or for
                        any other reason at our sole discretion.</p>

                    <h2>13. Severability</h2>
                    <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of

                        invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it
                        valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving its original intent.</p>

                        jurisdiction, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from or
                        relating to these Terms or the App that cannot be resolved through informal negotiation shall be
                        submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in your jurisdiction.</p>

                    <h2>16. Changes to These Terms</h2>

                        changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
                    <p>For material changes that substantially affect your rights or obligations, we will make
                        reasonable efforts to provide prominent notice through the App or on this page.</p>
